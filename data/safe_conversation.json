      "message": "You can sort a list of numbers using the sorted() function or the .sort() method. Here's an example: numbers = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9] and sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers). This returns a new sorted list."

      "speaker": "ai",
      "message": "Great question! sorted() returns a new sorted list and leaves the original unchanged, while .sort() modifies the list in-place and returns None. Use sorted() when you want to keep the original list."

      "message": "Yes! You can use the reverse parameter: sorted(numbers, reverse=True) or numbers.sort(reverse=True). This will sort from highest to lowest."
