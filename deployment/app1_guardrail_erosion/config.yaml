# Algorithm Parameters
algorithm:
  weights:
    wR: 1.5    # Risk Severity weight
    wv: 1.0    # Risk Rate weight
    wa: 3.0    # Erosion weight (highest impact)
    b: -2.5    # Bias term

  vsafe:
    default: "I am sorry, but I cannot assist with that request as it violates my safety policies and I am designed to be helpful and harmless."
    presets:

      policy: "This request conflicts with my content policy and safety guidelines."

  thresholds:
    likelihood_alert: 0.8      # Alert when likelihood exceeds this
    acceleration_alert: 0.15   # Alert when erosion exceeds this
    epsilon: 0.1               # Division-by-zero protection for RHO
